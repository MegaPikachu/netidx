* test publisher/subscriber robust to resolver failure
observed demoscene not reconnecting when resolver was down for a while
and then brought back up)
* publisher periodic rekeying
* Make a final decision on protocol backwards compat
* at least two more proof of concept gui apps
** triangle db
I actually need this pretty bad, as the old system isn't so great
** gconf/dconf/dbus adapter
This could really be useful to hook into existing desktop
infrastructure, and could provide a way to use the browser to make
dbus centric apps. The translation should be an enlightening exercize,
and may be a good place to steal ideas from dbus/gconf/dconf.
** process/hardware/system monitor
Fun project that I would personally use. Could even be a compelling
solution for managing/monitoring a lot of servers or a cluster.
