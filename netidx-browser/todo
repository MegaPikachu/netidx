* when there are nested grids, child grid rows are not highlighted correctly

* there is an intermittant bug when switching rows the widgets that
  are hidden are interactable even though they're hidden, while the
  visible widgets are not. (maybe fixed)

* Graphs are blank after long period of inactivity/sleep even though
  labels are updating.
